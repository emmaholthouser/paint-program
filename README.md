# paint-program
This was one a the final projects in a programming for Visualization course. The professor gave us some starter code and we were tasked with creating a simple "paint" like program using C++ and openGL. Using the program the user can choose a color to either free hand draw on the screen, or create a line, a filled shape, or a unfilled shape. The user can also save, and load saved images, and clear or exit the program.
